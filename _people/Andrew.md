### About
My name is Andrew Schleffer and I am a Junior majoring in Psychology with a specialization in Behavioral & Cognitive Neuroscience. I am currently on the Pre-Med track, so when I'm not in class you can either find me crying in Marston Basement or squashed beneath the crushing weight of STEM. On the rare chance I get out of the library, I enjoy beach volleyball as well as any other sport with a ball (or frisbee, I don't discriminate). 


### Current Projects
My focus in the lab is primarily dealing with the process of screening pregnant moms for entry into our study. I also assist Dr. Lemas with a side project focusing on WasteWater Epidemiology.
